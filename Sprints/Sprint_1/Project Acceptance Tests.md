### Objectives
This document outlines the strategies and methodologies used to test the project to ensure it meets the client's requirements. 

### Document References
This document specifies testing criteria for the project requirements outlined in the Requirements Analysis Document. 

Creation of a secure web-based shop front for event attendees:

1. to book his/her attendance (including partner, children);
2. to register contact details;
3. to indicate no fees involved;
4. to enable uploading images/text; and
5. to interface with printer to generate badges

Security of data is an important consideration.

### Test Summary

1. Publicly visible website
2. Website lists event information
3. Users may book their attendance for an event
4. Users may register their contact details
5. Users may pay for tickets via a payment processor
6. The system can generate printable attendance badges
7. User data, ticketing and transactions are handled securely
8. Event managers can mark attendance

### Testing Strategy

The event management system comprises three major systems;

- Website store-front for attendees to book
- Database backend to store event, attendee and ticketing information
- A ticket check-in interface for event management to determine ticket validity

These systems should be tested individually after any code changes are made to ensure their functionality is not compromised, and they should be tested together after any major changes.
